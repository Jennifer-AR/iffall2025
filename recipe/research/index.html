        <li>272 g cake flour (9.6 ounces; 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons), plus more for dusting</li>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Heat the oven and prep the pan:</strong> Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 325°F (160°C). Liberally spray a 10-cup Bundt pan with cooking spray and dust well with flour, tapping out the excess. A well-coated pan keeps the swirl defined and prevents sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together cake flour, baking powder, and salt until evenly combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the fats and sugar:</strong> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together cream cheese, butter, and vegetable shortening on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl halfway through. With the mixer on low, sift the flour mixture directly into the bowl and beat until just combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Add eggs and vanilla:</strong> In a measuring cup, whisk together the eggs and vanilla extract. With the mixer running on low, slowly add 1 cup granulated sugar, then gradually pour in the egg mixture. Add the remaining sugar and beat until smooth and glossy, about 2 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed. The batter should look thick and silky.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the chocolate swirl base:</strong> In a heatproof bowl, whisk together chopped chocolate, sugar, cocoa powder, and espresso powder. Pour hot water over the top and whisk until smooth. Fold in 1 1/2 cups of the vanilla batter to create the chocolate swirl mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Marble the batter:</strong> Spoon half of the vanilla batter into the prepared Bundt pan and smooth it into an even layer. Dollop the chocolate mixture over the top, then cover with the remaining vanilla batter. Use a butter knife or offset spatula to gently drag through the batter in a figure-eight motion — two or three passes are enough for a defined swirl.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake until the cake is golden brown, risen, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through baking for even browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for 25 minutes. Run a thin offset spatula or knife along the edges and center to loosen, then carefully invert onto the rack. Let the cake cool completely — at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours — before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Dust the cooled cake with confectioners' sugar, or drizzle with warm chocolate sauce. For clean slices, use a serrated knife and wipe the blade between cuts.</li>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For the fluffiest texture, weigh ingredients when possible and let the butter and eggs come fully to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Use high-quality Dutch-process cocoa for a deep chocolate flavor. Natural cocoa will work, but the color will be lighter.</li>
        <li>A light-colored Bundt pan promotes even browning; dark pans may reduce bake time by a few minutes.</li>
