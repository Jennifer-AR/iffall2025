     <p class="lines">Chorus</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Suspended</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I've been lifted by her love</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I fell lifted from above</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Suspended</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I've been lifted by her love</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I fell lifted from above</p>


          <p class="lines">Verse 1</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I was in and out, but drowning more and more</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Sipping on red wine, I spilled it on the floor</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Then I find myself, all washed up by the shore</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Artificial light, a glowing phone the source</p>
     <p class="lyrics">It would wake me up, alarm with no remorse</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Then I find this memory when we're high abroad</p>
      <p class="lyrics">Round about the time that we were still unsure</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Stoppin' on this photo, I really do j'adore</p>
     <p class="lyrics">The vanilla skies, we step onto the moor</p>
     <p class="lyrics">In Italy, in Florence where we walk</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Where the sun it shines, a yellow tint we talk</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Can't we go back to how we were before</p>
     <p class="lyrics">But we're not where we used to be, of course</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I lost the map but still we could explore</p>
     <p class="lyrics">We're going up, we're wired to the force</p>
     <p class="lyrics">A force we're on course, we're</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Of course, we're</p>


     <p class="lines">Chorus</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Suspended</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I've been lifted by her love</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I fell lifted from above</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Suspended</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I've been lifted by her love</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I fell lifted from above</p>


     <p class="lines">Verse 2</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Still a mystery the feelings I ignore</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Like running from what I've been looking for</p>
     <p class="lyrics">In-between the moments, each one like sliding doors</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I was in and out, time don't make sense no more</p>
     <p class="lyrics">In another life, we were two birds that soared</p>
     <p class="lyrics">In another life, I don't know who you are</p>
      <p class="lyrics">I'm a troubled mind, reality divorced</p>
     <p class="lyrics">When you ask me if I love you, I'm</p>


          <p class="lines">Chorus</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Suspended</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I've been lifted by her love</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I fell lifted from above</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Suspended</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I've been lifted by her love</p>
     <p class="lyrics">I fell lifted from above</p>

     
       <p class="lines">Outro</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Time issue, time travel</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Back, forward, back with you</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Time issue, I miss you</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Life, issues, time</p>
