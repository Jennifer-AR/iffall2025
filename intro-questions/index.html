        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p><b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b></p>
        <p>My name is Jennifer Alexander, I'm a junior studying Communication Design.</p>

        <p><b>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></p>
        <p>I'm from Houston, TX so St. Louis is definitely a break from the unbearable heat I was dealing with over the summer. 
        This is a required course for me but I have taken principles of web design where we used Figma and I wanted to learn more about html to make websites that are more functional.
        </p>

        <p><b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></p>
        <p>I have a little bit of experience from using it in Type 1 last semester for our chapbook assignment.</p>

        <p><b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></p>
        <p>One thing I hope to learn is translating grids and layouts that I use into something I can do with HTML.</p>

        <p><b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></p>
        <p>Designing for the screen isn't as flexible and since you have to start with code first you're not constantly seeing the edits in real time like you are in InDesign for example.</p>

        <p><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>Chief.com is easy to navigate and looks clean, so it's simple to find what you're looking for. The design is consistent and works well on both desktop and mobile.</p>
        
        <p><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>Slack.com communicates really clearly what the platform does and why it's useful. The site uses simple language, clear visuals, and easy navigation, so you get the info without any confusion.</p>

        <p><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></p>
        <p>Lumen Art Space's website is visually striking and easy to navigate. It showcases artwork front and center, uses clean layouts and high-quality images to showcase Vietnamese art.</p>
