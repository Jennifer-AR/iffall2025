    <h3>FOLDING THE ORDINARY INTO THE EXTRAORDINARY</h3>
    <p>Born from centuries of Japanese tradition.</p>
    <p>
      Origami — from the Japanese ori (to fold) and kami (paper) — transforms
      a simple sheet into infinite form. What begins as a flat surface becomes
      pattern and idea which balances precision, patience, and imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond its beauty, origami bridges art, mathematics, and philosophy. Each
      crease tells a story of structure and intention where geometry meets
      grace, and simplicity reveals complexity. It's both a craft, and a
      language of creation.

    <p class="description">
      Born in Japan during the Heian period, origami began as a sacred act —
      a reflection of balance, beauty, and devotion. Much like the Phoenix Hall
      of Byōdō-in, it embodies the harmony between art and spirituality. Over
      time, folding evolved from ritual practice to a universal language of
      creativity and precision.

        <h4>The Craft</h4>
        <p>
          Highlight: Paper was first introduced to Japan from China via Korea. By the Heian period, Japanese papermakers developed washi through the nagashi-suki technique, producing stronger sheets.Significance: These new materials gave rise to ceremonial origami (girei origami) — folded forms for Shinto rituals and gift wrapping, such as gohei, ōnusa, and shide. Folding became a symbol of purity and respect

        <h4>Muromachi Period</h4>
        <p>
          Highlight: Aristocratic etiquette evolved under the Ogasawara and Ise clans, formalizing folding rituals. Ise Sadachika refined origami etiquette for samurai and daimyō households during the Ashikaga Shogunate. Significance: This period defined the geometry of ceremonial origami— structured, abstract shapes representing honor and harmony. Wedding traditions like noshi and butterfly folds originate here.

          Highlight: Folding became recreational. Decorative patterns appeared on kimonos and architecture (ranma panels). In 1747, Ranma Zushiki included playful origami designs, showing how the craft had entered daily life. Significance: In 1797, Akisato Ritō's Hiden Senbazuru Orikata documented 49 intricate crane folds by Buddhist monk Gidō — the first known technical book on origami.

         Highlight: With the modernization of Japan, origami entered formal education. Influenced by Friedrich Fröbel's kindergarten system, folding was used to teach geometry and creativity. Significance: This integration marked the transition from ritual and leisure to structured pedagogy — paper folding as both art and education.

          Highlight: Akira Yoshizawa revolutionized origami through wet-folding, giving paper sculptural realism. He also developed the Yoshizawa-Randlett notation system, a global standard for folding diagrams. Significance: His work transformed origami into modern art, inspiring movements worldwide and bridging tradition with mathematical precision.

        <h4>Post War to Present</h4>
        <p>
          Highlight: Origami expanded globally. Artists like Josef Albers incorporated folding into Bauhaus design, while new methods like modular origami and curved folding pushed the boundaries of the medium. Significance: Origami now merges with engineering, architecture, and science, shaping deployable structures and space technology. The fold has become a universal design language — precise, poetic, and endlessly adaptable.

         <h2>The Craft</h2>
         <p>
         Origami is built on restraint — a quiet balance between control and possibility.A single sheet, without cuts or glue, transforms through intention alone. Each crease becomes a decision — visible proof of precision and patience. At its core, origami embodies-wabi-sabi, the Japanese appreciation for simplicity, imperfection, and transience. Folding is both meditative and mathematical — where structure emerges from stillness. The language of origami is universal. Every model begins with a base — a sequence of folds that forms the skeleton of design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Square Base-the foundation for birds,cranes, and traditional forms. Fish Base — used for animal and organic designs. Frog Base — complex, multi-layered foundation for insects and creatures. Each base connects through a shared system of folds: Valley Fold — the paper bends toward you. Mountain Fold — the paper folds away from you.

        <h4>Scientific Applications</h4>
        <p>
          Its geometry guides engineers, physicists, and designers, reshaping how structures move, compress, and expand. From space telescopes that unfurl in orbit to medical stents that open within the human body, origami's logic has become a tool of precision design. Each fold is a solution — efficient, scalable, and elegantly engineered. Modern researchers and artists — including Robert J. Lang, Erik Demaine, and Tomohiro Tachi — fuse mathematics and art to explore new possibilities. Their work proves that folding is not just aesthetic, but algorithmic: a study in structure and transformation. What was once hand and paper now informs robotics, aeronautics, and materials science — a dialogue between creativity and computation.

      <div class="reach-category">
        <h4>Architecture & Design Influence</h4>
        <p>
          The visual rhythm of origami — repetition, symmetry, and light play — has transformed how we think about form. Architects fold steel, glass, and fabric into structures that move like paper, creating spaces that breathe, contract, and expand. Origami-inspired architecture appears in the Miura fold, used for solar panels and collapsible roofs, and in modern facades that respond to sunlight and airflow. Each design honors the same principles: minimal material, maximal transformation. In fashion, designers reinterpret folds as structure — sculptural garments that echo the logic of paper, turning fabric into living geometry. Pleats, panels, and layered construction all carry the mark of origami's discipline and delicacy.

        <h4>Cultural Impact</h4>
        <p>
          The paper crane, or orizuru, stands as a global emblem of compassion, amplified by the story of Sadako Sasaki, whose thousand cranes became a call for peace. Beyond symbolism, origami appears in film, animation, and literature — from motifs of transformation in Blade Runner and Paperman to the folds that metaphorically tie worlds together in contemporary storytelling.
